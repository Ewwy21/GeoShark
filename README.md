# GeoShark
Fullstack Academy Group Capstone Project: GeoShark

Pyshark.py parses PCAP files for IP-related information and KML data. 
Running with a a .pcap file will create three files: summary.txt, report.txt, and mappcap.kml. 

The folder must also contain GeoLiteCity.dat. Credit to the creator: https://github.com/mbcc2006/GeoLiteCity-data

With a shebang already in the Pyshark.py:
./Pyshark.py <insert packet capture file>
